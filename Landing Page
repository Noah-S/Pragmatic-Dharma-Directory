<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hello and welcome to the Pragmatic Dharma Directory!</span></h2>
<p>This website is meant to serve as a nexus point for all of the in-person pragmatic dharma meetups that are now starting to take place around the globe. &nbsp;There are lots of other great sites that host virtual sanghas, online learning resources &amp; traditional in person sanghas. &nbsp;We will link to many of those at the bottom of this page!</p>
<p>In general, the sanghas on this page are post-traditional in that they align to a few, core values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peer led / non-heirerchacial&nbsp;</li>
<li>Openness&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focus on what works, including D.I.Y. and/or working with a teacher</li>
<li>Empowerment / awakening is possible</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not attempting to provide a complete definition of pragmatic here. &nbsp;This has already been done in other places such as on the Dharma Overground, the Awake Network, Reddit Stream Entry &amp; Buddhist Geeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pragmatic Dharma Directory is a loose connection of communities. &nbsp;Each group will likely have different emphases in terms of tradition, technique, meeting logistics &amp; how they stay in touch betweeen meetings. &nbsp;Each group is encouraged to open into the continual play of impermanence &amp; causality that we live in. &nbsp;Independence, innovation &amp; fun are key values. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the list below to find a meetup near you. &nbsp;If you are interested in starting one, please email <a href="mailto:seattlespuds@gmail.com">seattlespuds@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;for help on how to get started.</p>
